In Next.js 15, using the `app` directory with dynamic routes and nested layouts can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful with data fetching.  For example, if you have a layout that fetches data based on a route parameter, and a nested page uses that same parameter, the data might not be correctly passed down if the parameter changes during navigation.  This often results in stale data being displayed or components not re-rendering with the updated data.
